## Messy data

- Most people have heard of the 80/20 dilemma
- [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#72f53456f637)
  + 76% of data scientists view data preparation as the least enjoyable part of their work
- I actually enjoy it.....sometimes!

## Why should you clean your data? 
- [Towards Data Science article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-data-cleaning-3969843991d4)
- Garbage in, Garbage out
- Quality data beats fancy algorithms
- You want data that is:
  + Valid - Does the data conform to constraints
  + Accurate - Is the data true
  + Complete - Missingness will happen but there are ways to mitigate this
  + Consistent - Is data consistent across variables
  + Uniform - Are all units within a column and across datasets measured the same way 

## Other good data cleaning rules
- Descriptive variable names with no spaces
- Only one piece of information per column
- No characters (ex: $) in columns unless it is a string variable
- No unclear values in cells
- No duplicate entries
- De-identify data if necessary (drop columns)
  
## How should you structure your data?
- [Tidy Data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) (Table 1) vs. (Table 2)

## Examples of messy data
- There are endless types of data you may encounter
  + Spreadsheets, text files, PDFs, word documents, APIs, webscraping, databases, googlesheets, etc.
- Let's look at some examples of messy data
  + Example 1: Long variable names with spaces, unnecessary rows and cols, unclear values, col with more than one piece of info
  + Example 2: Poor structure, values as variable names, missing data (need to fill)
  + Example 3: Unstructured data
  + Example 4: Characters in numeric cols, some values not valid, unclear variables, non-uniform cols

## Why use R and RStudio
- Allows us to perform cleaning tasks without ever touching the raw data
- It also allows:
  + Our cleaning to be reproducible and reusable
  + Us to export clean data or do analyses on clean data within R
  + Us to document our steps
  + Create codebooks 
  + To show data descriptives in reports

## My typical data cleaning steps
1. Read in file/s and explore data
2. Drop columns (Ex: De-identify data - remove name)
3. Rename columns (Ex: Descriptive names, remove spaces)
4. Filter data (Ex: remove those with missing IDs)
5. Remove duplicates
6. Transform/create cols (Ex: string->numeric, or remove $ or %)
7. Recode variables (Ex: NA->0, reverse code likert scale)
8. Transform data (Ex: from wide to long or long to wide)
9. Merge data and/or append data
10. Add variable labels
11. Make codebook
12. Export data

 
## Cleaning steps and associated packages/functions

## Tidyverse 
- Most of these packages can be loaded through the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
  + "Opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."  
  + Included packages: magrittr, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purr, tibble, stringr, forcats
  + Many others not loaded automatically: ex: readxl, lubridate

## Piping
- Magrittr allows the use of piping (%>%)
  + Piping allows us to chain several chunks of code together
- I could write these 3 lines of code separately
  + data<-read_excel("file.xlsx")
  + data<-select(data,column1:column3)
  + data<-setNames(data, c("ID","Gender","Test_Score"))
- OR I could use piping
  + data<-read_excel("file.xlsx")%>%
  select(column1:column3)%>%
  setNames(c("ID","Gender","Test_Score"))

## Other tips
- Use [RProjects](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)
  + [Organize your directory within RProjects](https://richpauloo.github.io/2018-10-17-How-to-keep-your-R-projects-organized/)
  + Name files specifically and with no spaces
- Use [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) as part of your reproducible research to showcase script, data documentation, and output all in one document
- Comment every step 
- Use keyboard [shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts?mobile_site=true)
  + Alt key to highlight a column of data or make a multi-line cursor
  + Ctrl+Shift+M inserts pipe operator
  + Shift+Ctrl+R adds a header
  + Ctrl+Enter to run a line of R code

## Let's clean some data
- Scenario: We are running a research study in a school district
- We currently have study data which includes StudyID and Treatment Status
- We want to know if treatment impacts student outcomes so we request data from the district
- We have a district Student ID in our data that we can use to merge files. 
- Here is what we receive:
  + One file that includes demographics and attendance
  + One file that includes discipline referrals
- What might we need to clean in these files?
- Which file do you want to tackle first?
